Data were collected from physical experiments on the study of palladium-based nanocatalysts using synchrotron radiation
for the period from 2013 to 2021. The data collection was based on BM26A and BM31 (BM01b) beamline of the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Here are the results of software implementation of tools for preprocessing and
presentation of experimental data in a convenient format. Thus, the result of the deposited datasets is represented by
Sfedu_csv_parser / Results /" as 4 files with the extension" *.CSV. The installation file for the latest stable version
of the handler is located at "Sfedu_csv_parser / Output /". Requirements: IBM-compatible, OS versions: Win7-Win10 /.
The development was carried out using the C # language. The project itself is hosted by "Sfedu_csv_parser / CSVParser /",
where the main classes used are presented in "Sfedu_csv_parser / CSVParser / Refactoring /".
